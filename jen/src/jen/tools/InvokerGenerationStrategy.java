/** 
 * Encapsulates the proxy invocation strategy for a {@link SoftProxy} generation.
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for generating proxy invocation 
 * methods for supplied {@link Method}s, and generating any instance initialization
 * required by the invokers. A custom implementation can be supplied at generation
 * time to replace the {@link java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler}-based strategy 
 * employed by {@link jen.tools.DefaultInvokerStrategy}.
 * <p/>
 * {@code SoftProxy} generates a set of static final fields on the proxy class,
 * holding the {@code Method} instances relating to each method. The field name
 * can be obtained for a given {@code Method} instance via the 
 * {@link SoftProxy#methodFieldName(String)} method. This can be used to 
 * generate a {@code GETSTATIC} instruction to place the appropriate {@code Method}
 * on to the stack, from where it can be used as appropriate. 
 * <p/>
 * These fields, and the associated {@code <clinit>} block, are generated implicitly,
 * and cannot be directly influenced. There is no guarantee that either will have
 * been generated on the {@link SoftClass} at the time the methods of this class 
 * are called, and furthermore there is no guarantee that, apart from the 
 * afterGeneration method (see below) these methods will be called in any particular
 * order.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #afterGeneration(SoftClass)} method is a special case, that is called
 * exactly once per proxy, and always after all other generation has taken place.
 * This can be used to handle any final generation required by the strategy.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of this class are not required to be thread-safe, or even provide
 * meaningful operation across multiple proxy generations. Although the

 * N.B. 0.30 breaks binary compatibility on this interface. Sorry about that :(
 * 
 * The impact is not especially great - it's mainly that the previous generateInstanceInit
 * method has been renamed to 'afterGeneration', and is now guaranteed to be called after
 * the invocation methods have been generated.
 * 
 * Well-behaved old implementations can easily be migrated up by either refactoring 
 * the method, or adding a new afterGeneration method and calling the generateInstanceInit
 * method from it. This should be fine since previously the method wasn't guaranteed to
 * be called before the invokers anyway.
