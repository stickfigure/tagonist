Optional high-level tools that facilitate classworking with Jen. This package provides useful
classes that assist in using <a href='http://jen.dev.java.net/' target='_blank'>Jen</a> for 
many common classworking tasks, such as generating dynamic proxies for both interface and concrete classes, 
creating constraint-based <em>mock implementations</em>, and so on.
<p/>
Many of the features provided by this package can be found in other systems, such as Cglib (proxies) and
MockObjects or JMock (mocks). However, the highly intuitive API and tight integration between the various
parts mean that Jen can provide greater flexibility, with less impact on overall system architecture and
legwork on the part of the developer.
