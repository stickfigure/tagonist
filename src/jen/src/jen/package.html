This is the core package of the <a href='http://jen.dev.java.net/' target='_blank'>Jen</a> bytecode
generation and class transformation API for Java(tm). It provides the mandatory core functionality required by 
Jen, and includes the main {@link jen.SoftClass} and {@link jen.SoftMember} interfaces, as well as the base 
implementations that allow existing classes to be modelled, and abstract base-classes for custom members. 
<p/>
Jen also provides a variety of standard member implementations covering a range of common use-cases, in
the optional <a href='http://jen.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/multiproject/members/apidocs/index.html' target='_blank'>
Jen Members</a> library.
