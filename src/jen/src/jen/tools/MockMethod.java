/**

 * is queried in turn, and the first that indicates it can handle the invocation
 * is called upon to do so.
 * <p/>
 * Any methods on the proxy that do not have a matching MockMethod will be handled
 * by the <em>default MockMethod</em>, which simply returns <code>null</code>.
 * <strong>Note that this includes both equals and hashCode at present</strong>, so
 * you <strong>must</strong> provide stubs for them if you plan to use your mocks
 * as collection keys, for example.
