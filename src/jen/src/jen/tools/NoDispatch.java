/** 
 * Indicates to the {@link MultiDispatchStrategy} that the annotated
 * method should be <strong>excluded</strong> from multiple dispatch,
 * resulting in them being ignored when searching for a method to
 * invoke for a given set of arguments.
 * <p/>
 * The primary intended purpose of this annotation is to allow an
 * all-{@link Object}-argument overload to be declared, allowing the
 * method to be called with varying arguments at compile time. At
 * run-time, calls to this method will enter the dispatcher as normal,
 * and be passed to another overload on the superclass if possible.
 * When searching for an overload, however, the annotated method will
 * be ignored.
 * <p/>
 * Without this annotation the common requirement for an all-Object
 * overload would limit the dispatcher's usefullness, since there 
 * would be no way to prevent method calls with absolutely any
 * arguments from being dispatched to that overload on the superclass.
 * With it, these methods become essentially 'placeholders' that
 * exist purely for use at compile time - any arguments passed in
 * through that overload that cannot be matched to a non-{@code NoDispatch}
 * method will cause a {@link NoSuchMethodError} to be thrown.
